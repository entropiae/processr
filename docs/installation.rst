Installation
============

The easiest way to install processr is using pip::

    $ pip install processr

Otherwise you can install it from Github::

    $ git clone https://github.com/entropiae/processr.git
    $ cd process
    $ python setup.py install

Dependencies
============

processr is written in pure Python and does not require runtime dependencies :-)

Python
======

processr is compatible with Python 2.7 / 3.3+ / PyPy. It should also work with Python 2.6, but I haven't tested it
(if you can, you should consider to `stop using it <http://www.snarky.ca/stop-using-python-2-6>`_).
